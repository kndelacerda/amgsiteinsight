# 1.2.2 Fix Resource Mapping

**NEW:**
* This patch installs `keen-core@0.1.2` and removes the internal `queries` resource mapping (now in keen-core) to fix an issue with prototype inheritance and state.


<a name="1.2.1"></a>
# 1.2.1 Global Namespace Fix (Pt2)

**FIXED:**
* This patch isolates global namespace definition and installs `keen-core@0.1.1` to fix an issue where prototype methods of other SDKs were blended into this SDK's prototype.


<a name="1.2.0"></a>
# 1.2.0 Global Namespace Fix

**FIXED:**
* This library will now coalesce into a shared global `Keen` namespace, rather than colliding and overwriting other modular SDKs. Check out [keen-core.js@0.1.0](https://github.com/keen/keen-core.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#010-manage-modular-namespace) for details about this fix.

# 1.0.0 Remove keen-tracking.js

**Change:**
* Important update: [keen-tracking.js](https://github.com/keen/keen-tracking.js) is no longer built into this SDK (#7). This is an intentional decision to prevent publicly hosted releases of this essential SDK from being blacklisted and blocked by AdBlockers. Learn more about installing keen-tracking.js [here](https://github.com/keen/keen-tracking.js#install-the-library).
